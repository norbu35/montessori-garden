  <SectionLayout heading="Our Approach">
    <p>
      We are a small family-run nursery school driven by the love and passion of
      children and their development, and we believe in the natural capabilities
      of each child to effortlessly learn with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our thoughtfully prepared environment is curated to support their
      individual needs and interests and has a great influence in optimising
      education, learning and development - setting a solid base for a lifelong
      joy of learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      All our staff share our core values and are with us because they are
      committed to providing exceptional care that fosters love and trust. Every
      child has the potential to be great, and we're here to help them discover
      and develop their natural abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that education is not just about what children learn, but also
      how they learn, and we're dedicated to providing an experience that will
      stay with your child for life.
