We are very happy that Emily Dankworth, granddaughter of Dame Cleo Laine and
Sir John Dankworth, Jazz Musicians, will be coming to do music sessions with
the children at school. She specialises in Jazz-oriented music classes with
Live musicians and instruments. Our first taster session was brilliant and our
2 and 3 year olds were engaged for 45 minutes. Believe me, thatâ€™s a hard task
to achieve ðŸ˜Š?
