We have exciting news! In response to working parents’ needs and requests,
Montessori Garden is now expanding our services and will be accepting babies as
young as 3 months old in our new babyroom in 2020!

With a separate pre-school room, our older children will be able to work and
play with the more advanced materials during work cycle, while still having the
opportunity to interact with the younger children outside of the work cycle,
following our belief in vertical grouping as an essential element of each
child’s education.
