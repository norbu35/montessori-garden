“All children are making good progress in their learning and development. They
are independent, confident, articulate, individuals who are enthusiastic about
learning, characteristics, which will effectively support them in their future
readiness for school.”

“Children enjoy their time at the nursery. They part happily and settle quickly
because staff are attentive of their arrival. They are very well behaved and
staff effectively support children to learn how to resolve their conflicts.
There is a strong sense of community as they share tasks such as laying the
tables. They demonstrate genuine concern for each other as they help clear up
each other’s mess. They learn about self-care as they pour their own drinks and
wipe their nose in front of the mirror to ensure they do it successfully. The
free flow environment means that children can have plenty of access to fresh
air and outdoor learning.”

“The quality of teaching is good throughout the nursery; the environment is
stimulating and resources freely accessible to all children. As a result,
children are independent learners who explore, investigate and create using
their own ideas. Staff interactions further their learning though thoughtful
questions and shared experiences. For example, children watering plants were
encouraged to think about the life cycle of plants. Children enjoy creating
their own artwork using an array of different materials. They demonstrate good
teamwork and problem solving skills as they construct a bridge that ‘doesn’t
wobble’.”

Thank you to all our dedicated and passionate teachers and to Camden early years team for supporting us! Keep up the good work!
